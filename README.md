# Network Gaming Demo
<b>A client/server framework for an online side-scrolling game. Includes real time client updates, collision detection, and server management for players joining/leaving.</b>

Rendering is 100% SVG based, with the inital world stored on the server.

Leverages node.js, browserify, and the websocket library to implement client/server communication. The websocket node_module is included to ensure client compatability. 

Basic side scrolling and collision detection is included, but the art is basic to demonstrate functionality. This demo framework will eventually be updated to include animated characters.
